# Scaffolding User Stories

## Current Interactions
- Find fire hydrant
- Pass ten trees in a row
- Sprint to building
- Sprint to nearest bike rack (dummy event)

## Scaffolding Interactions
- Stand behind lamp post = identify -> read encrypted message

## Next Steps
- Show that lamp post scaffolding interaction actually works
  - Roadblock = iOS app no longer works on my iPhone...
- Create user stories for other interesting scaffolding interactions -- possibly one per current interaction?

## Possible Scaffolding Interactions
- Fire hydrant follow-up
  - Is it leaking or damaged?
  - Is there a car parked near it illegally?
  - What color is it?
- Ten trees follow-up
  - What type (shape/size/color) of leaves does the nth tree have?
  - Does the nth tree appear to have a disease?
  - Are there leaves on the nth tree?
- Building follow-up
  - What is the building size?
  - What is the building title?
  - Are there people outside of the building? i.e. is it open?
- Bike rack follow-up
  - Are any bikes stolen and/or damaged?
  - Are there open spaces in this bike rack?
  - Is the bike rack damaged?
