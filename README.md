# Navigating the project
All content specific to ZombieRunX can be found in the view controllers. The ExperienceKit code is organized by class, there is a separate file for each class. Classes are further grouped into models, managers, utilities, etc. The group names are self-explanatory and class definitions & properties are fairly well-commented regarding their purpose and usage.


## Branches
As of 9/22/2015, the master and "Scott" branches should be identical.
Please do not modify the "Scott" branch. It will be the easiest way for him to return to this code
without needing to handle modifications that happened since his lab rotation.
